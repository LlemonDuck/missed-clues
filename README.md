    <h3>Missed Clues</h3>
    <h4>You haven't got a clue what you're missin'</h4>
</div>

### Features
* If the message "You have a sneaking suspicion that you would have received a clue..." is received, the plugin simulates a clue of that tier, as if you had received and completed it!
* Shows the items and current value of these items.
* Tracks the number of missed clues you've (not) received, by tier.
* Makes you wonder about what could have been.

### Configuration

Configuration is available on a tier-by-tier basis with the following configuration options available:
* <b>Clue Pop-up</b>: Shows all simulated clue items in the 'incinerator clue scroll' pop-up window:

* <b>Both</b>: Shows both the Chat Message & Clue Pop-up (default)
* <b>None</b>: Shows neither (This still tracks your clues killed count!)

Special thanks to ste for all his help on this. Couldn't have done it without you.
